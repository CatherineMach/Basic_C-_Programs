C# Projects 

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

Projects:

* Car Insurance
* Twenty One





Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.


Twenty One
This project I made a black jack or "Twenty One" card game, using different classes and methods to properly working. Some methods like "walking away", player staying in another round, reaching $0 and losing, etc.
